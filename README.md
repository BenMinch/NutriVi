# NutriVi
Calculate nutritional information for virus genomes. This simple program can take as input any fasta file (proteins or genomes) and output nutritional information such as average nitrogen/sulfur per sidechain (protein), nitrogen: carbon ratio, protein carbon content, etc. 

## Usage

### Dependencies
Pandas and numpy (Python packages)

### Options

* -i: Folder with DNA files in fasta format
* -p: Folder with protein files in fasta format

You don't need both of these to run the program.
